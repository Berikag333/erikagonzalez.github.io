  tagline: `Data defines direction.
I turn complexity into clarity.
Curiosity and discipline drive every decision I make.
With an MBA and over ten years of experience, I combine strategy with analytical thinking.
Data has never been just numbers to me — it’s insight waiting to be uncovered.
I’ve challenged assumptions and reshaped strategy through evidence.
International experience across Europe and Mexico has strengthened my analytical and cultural perspective.
I work with SQL, Python, and Tableau to transform insight into measurable business impact.
Because assumptions inspire ideas — but evidence drives growth.`,
